“The Tectonic Map of the World by Exxon (1985) was the main source of information to classify geologic provinces and thermo-tectonic age in the Phanerozoic.
The maps 'Seismicity and Tectonics of Stable Continental Regions' of the project 'Earthquakes of Stable Continental Regions' by EPRI (1994); Precambrian Geology (Goodwin, 1991); and Principles of Precambrian Geology (Goodwin, 1996) were the main sources of information to classify regions of Precambrian thermo-tectonic age.
