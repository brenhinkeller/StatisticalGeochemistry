               Parsons and Sclater (1977) plate model. This model
               is not shown in our G-cubed paper, but included here
               for completeness.  In our view it is still a useful
               reference model.
               Units are in meters.
               The geographic grid spans longitudes from 0 E to
               360 E and latitudes from 90 N to -90 N.
               5 minute resolution, gridline-registered.   

The directory also contains 4 GMT colour palette files (.cpt): age.cpt,
ageerror.cpt, rate.cpt and asym.cpt.

All grid file names follow the convention to use two numbers to indicate
					the file version number followed by the resolution in
					minutes. Therefore age_3.2.img corresponds to version 3
					with 2 minute resolution.
					
About .img files:	The Mercator projected .img files can be accessed with
					Wessel and Smith's Generic Mapping Tools (GMT) program
					img2mercgrd:
					 
					 img2mercgrd age3.2.img -R<west>/<east>/<south>/<north> -Gage3.2_myregion.grd -T1 -S0.01 -D-80.738/80.738
					
					The exact usage of img2mercgrd may depend on the GMT
					version you use.  

					Note that any inverse projection of the Mercator grid is
					unnecessary, as we provide a geographic age grid:
					age.3.2.nc

					The .img files have big_endian byte format (reflecting
					e.g. old Macs with Motorala CPU's and Sun SPARC computers).
					GMT's img2grd and img2mercgrd expects the files to be in
					the big-endian format (as we supply) and will automatically 
					apply a byte swap when used on little-endian hardware 
					(e.g. based on Intel or AMD chips).  If you use a program
					to read these files that require little-endian data input 
					use dd (on unix machines) to byte swap the img files: 
					dd if=orig.img of=new.img conv=swab.

					The .img files are pixel-registered (i.e. nodes centered on the grid boxes).  
					This differs from gridline-registered grids where nodes are at gridline intersections.
					Gridline-registered grids therefore have 1 row/column more than pixel-registrated grids.
	
About .nc files:	These are netCDF files adhering to the COORDS
					convention and may be used with any programs that supports 
					such files, such as the GMT programs (eg grdreformat for 
					converting the file to another format if desired, 
					grdmath for division of the grids by 10 (for age, rate,
					asym and age error grids) and grdimage for plotting.  
					GMT format file code is ns (short integer netCDF format). 
					
					The 6 minute age, rate and asymmetry grids are provided for 
					users who do not need high-resolution grids.  This
					resolution corresponds to that of our previous age grid
					(from 1997).

					Convert short integer .nc files to default GMT grd files
					as follows (for example). 
					
					grdmath age.3.6.nc=ns 0.01 MUL = age.3.6.grd=nf -V

					This example only works for GMT4.1 or above.  For older 
					versions of GMT, you may have to run grdreformat and
					grdmath separately.

					If you just want to convert  a .nc file to xyz, run, for example
					grd2xyz age.3.2.nc=ns/0.01/0 > age.3.2.xyz

					The .nc files are gridline-registered (i.e. nodes are at gridline intersections).  
					This differs from pixel-registered grids where nodes are centered on the grid boxes.
					Gridline-registered grids therefore have 1 row/column more than pixel-registrated grids.

All files are compressed with bzip2. Use bunzip2 for unzipping of the
files.  

Known Bugs:			Gridding artifacts exist around microplates (e.g.
					Bauer microplate), along fracture zones (e.g. Central Atlantic) and in
					areas with highly oblique spreading (e.g. South-West Indian Ridge).
					Minor interpolation artifacts along the margins of some back-arc basins.

Fixes:			02-04-09: Fixed interpolation error in the rate grid
along the prime meridin
					11-11-09: Values in age.3.6.xyz that were 9.9920072e-15
					were changed to 0.0
					11-09-08: Spreading asymmetry for crust without a present
					day conjugate is included in this version of the grid due to several
					requests received by the authors.	
					11-09-08: Adjustment to the location of chron M25 in the westernmost Pacific (Pacific-Izanagi) and to the age assigned to the Pacific triangle
					11-09-08: Minor COB modifications around back-arc basins to minimise over-interpolation artifacts from the adjacent subducting ocean floor
					04-04-08: Gridding artifact in the Bay of Bengal,
					eastern India and in the southern Indian Ocean, east of
					the Enderby Basin was fixed.
					04-04-08: Inclusion of the Komandorsky Basin and Bering
					Sea, North Pacific
